Psoriasis Disease Detection using Transfer Learning Models

## About Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a skin condition characterized by rashes, scaly patches, and itchy skin, often affecting areas like the chest, elbows, and scalp. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 125 million people worldwide, accounting for two to three percent of the population, suffer from psoriasis. About 30 percent of individuals with psoriasis may develop psoriatic arthritis, impacting their quality of life. The condition is prevalent among ages 20-30 and 50-60, with factors such as genetics, lifestyle, diet, medication, skin injuries, stress, immune disorders, and hormonal changes contributing to its occurrence.

## Repository Content
This repository contains a project focused on employing advanced deep learning techniques to classify seven types of psoriasis: Erythrodermic, Plaque, Guttate, Nail, Pustular, Inverse, and Psoriatic Arthritis. Using transfer learning with Inception ResNet50 and InceptionV3 models pretrained on ImageNet, we developed a robust system capable of accurately identifying these different psoriasis types.

## Datasets
Our approach involved training and fine-tuning the models using a custom dataset curated from publicly available sources such as SKIN LESION, ISIC, and DEMANSET datasets.

## Optimizers
By applying optimizers including Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad, we achieved classification accuracy exceeding 96%. This project not only advances dermatological diagnostics but also highlights the transformative potential of deep learning in healthcare applications.
